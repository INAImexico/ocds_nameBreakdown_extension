    "en": "In hispanic countries it is usual to breakdown the name into first name (with middle name when applicable) and the surnames (with the father’s surname and the mother’s surname). In the case of Mexican transparency obligations, it is mandatory to publish these data in separate fields. Likewise, we need to maintain the name of an organization in another separate field, in order to diference them with individuals.
